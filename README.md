# Go-Eat

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/goeat`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Why TOML?

I choose TOML simply because it's more human-readable and the format is much more simple especially for a nested list or dictionary.
